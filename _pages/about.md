I am a research scientist at the Met Office Hadley Centre working on the physics of climate change. I am mainly interested in the Earthâ€™s energy budget and how it can be used to understand climate change.  My research focuses on: Radiative forcing, climate feedbacks & heat uptake; Methods and concepts relating to climate sensitivity and transient climate change; Links between the energy and water cycles; Climate modelling. I work in the Climate Sensitivity and Feedbacks team, which forms part of the Climate Processes and Projections group in the Met Office Hadley Centre.
