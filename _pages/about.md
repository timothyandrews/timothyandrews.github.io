I am a research scientist at the Met Office Hadley Centre working on the physics of climate change. I am mainly interested in the Earthâ€™s energy budget and how it can be used to understand and predict climate change.  My research focuses on:

* Radiative forcing, climate feedbacks & heat uptake
* Methods and concepts relating to climate sensitivity and transient climate change
* Climate processes and projections
* Links between the energy and water cycles
* Climate modelling

I use observations, theory and a hierarchy of climate modelling to investigate these issues.

I work in the Climate Sensitivity and Feedbacks team, which forms part of the Climate Processes and Projections group in the Met Office Hadley Centre.
